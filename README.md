ABOUT THIS PROJECT
1. Data Collection:
Gather data from Airbnb's public API or other available sources. Collect information on listings, hosts, reviews, pricing, and location data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality. Convert data types, handle duplicates, and standardize formats.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns in the data. Explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.

4. Visualization:
Create visualizations to represent key metrics and trends. Use charts, graphs, and maps to convey information effectively. Consider using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizations.

5. Geospatial Analysis:
Utilize geospatial analysis to understand the geographical distribution of listings. Map out popular areas, analyze neighborhood characteristics, and visualize pricing variations.

6. Dashboard:
Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from your analysis. Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
